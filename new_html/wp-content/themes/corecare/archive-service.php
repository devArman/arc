                        We believe that bringing diagnostic testing and cardiac consultation together in one place is the best way to deliver efficient, highly effective care to our patients. This integrated approach extends beyond our clinic to include physicians and hospitals, ensuring the most rapid, effective treatment possible.

                        <p>
                            By making consultation with a
                            cardiologist available right in our clinic, we have the ability to perform tests and respond rapidly. Should it be necessary, alternate tests can be performed to determine if there are any serious issues, without our patients having to make another appointment with a lab or
                            specialist's office.

                        <p>
                            At CorCare, we form close partnerships with our patients and their doctors. Referring physicians work with CorCare specialists to provide the highest level of care. Depending on the needs of the patient, a CorCare physician is able to follow a patient's cardiac treatment directly through to the hospital. This provides tremendous consistency from diagnosis through to treatment with the same specialist managing the patient's care.

                        <p>
                            In the event that a patient is deemed
                            to be high risk, one of our CorCare
                            cardiologists can see him immediately. Our cardiologists keep time in their schedules open every day, and in the event of an abnormal test result, they
                            are always available to consult with
                            the patient that day.
