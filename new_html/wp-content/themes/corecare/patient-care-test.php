           about Cardiac Care tests
       </h2>
       <div class="page_text_block text-center">
           <p>Your heart is a muscle that receives its energy from blood carrying oxygen and nutrients. Having a constant supply
               of blood keeps your heart working properly. Most people think of heart disease as one condition, but in fact, heart
               disease is a group of conditions affecting the structure and functions of the heart and may have many root causes.
           </p>
           <p>
               To make a diagnosis, your doctor will most likely need to review your medical history.
               He or she may also want to run a few other tests before discussing your symptoms and recommending treatment.
               Several tests to diagnose possible heart diseases are available. The choice of which (and how many) tests to perform
               depends on several things. These include a patient's risk factors, history of heart problems, current symptoms
               and the doctor's interpretation of these factors.
           </p>
           <p>
               People being evaluated for possible heart disease are usually given simple tests first. Then more complicated ones
               may be used, if needed. Specific tests depend on the patient's particular problem(s) and the physician's assessment.
